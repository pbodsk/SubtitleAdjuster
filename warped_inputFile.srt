D'oh!

3
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:03,789
I can't believe it!
We won another contest.

4
00:02:03,893 --> 00:02:08,262
- The Simpsons are going to Delaware!
- I wanna see Wilmington!

5
00:02:08,364 --> 00:02:11,094
- I wanna visit a screen door factory.
- Yep.

6
00:02:11,201 --> 00:02:13,863
Delaware's got it all.

7

<i>You're next, Mr. Simpson.</i>

8
00:02:15,972 --> 00:02:19,430
- Hey, wait a minute. Airport tax: Five dollars?
- Sir, it's a standard fee.

9
00:02:19,542 --> 00:02:21,942
Well, we are not boarding that plane
unless you waive that tax.

10
00:02:23,046 --> 00:02:24,013
Waive it!

11
00:02:31,921 --> 00:02:33,821
Stupid anti-fist-shaking laws!

12
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:38,821
The Simpsons are riding the rails!

00:02:38,928 --> 00:02:41,123
Cool. A dead hobo.

14
00:02:43,399 --> 00:02:45,663
Mornin', folks.

15
00:02:45,768 --> 00:02:48,532
- What are you gonna do to us?
- Now, don't worry.

16
00:02:48,638 --> 00:02:51,004
I'm not a stabbin' hobo.
I'm a singin' hobo.

17

# Nothin' beats the hobo life #

- Excuse me, Hobo.

20
00:03:02,418 --> 00:03:05,046
Can you play something
a little less unnerving?

21
00:03:05,155 --> 00:03:07,316
Sure.

22
00:03:07,423 --> 00:03:10,119
I was just having a little fun
with you "nobos."

23
00:03:10,226 --> 00:03:13,662
Uh, here's a ballad that'll
set fire to your trash can.

Jeezum crow!

- How was it, honey?
- Whiskey, please.

30

00:04:13,723 --> 00:04:15,748
Hey, Paul, flapjacks!

00:04:19,729 --> 00:04:22,493
Flapjacks!

41

Out of the frying pan!

42
00:04:28,705 --> 00:04:32,266
Yuck! All right, uh,
let's get started on lunch.

43

- And-Wait. Where's Lenny?
- <i>Hello?</i>

Can anybody hear me?

45
00:04:39,349 --> 00:04:41,249
I think I found a way out.

46
00:04:41,351 --> 00:04:43,945
It's not pretty, but it'll do.

47
00:04:47,156 --> 00:04:49,454
<i>All right, look, we gotta</i>
<i>do something about Bunyan.</i>

48
00:04:49,559 --> 00:04:51,754
We're going bankrupt
just feedin' and clothin' the guy...

49
00:04:51,861 --> 00:04:53,761
not to mention the crushings.

50
00:04:53,863 --> 00:04:58,664
Hey, I say we get him drunk
and drag him out of town.

51
00:04:58,768 --> 00:05:01,328
Same way we got rid of
Laura Ingalls Wilder.

52
00:05:01,437 --> 00:05:03,564
Yeah, that's a great idea!

53
00:05:03,673 --> 00:05:07,040
Hmm.

54
00:05:07,143 --> 00:05:09,543
Uh, hey, Paulie?

55
00:05:09,646 --> 00:05:12,410
What say we buy you a beer?

56
00:05:17,053 --> 00:05:20,853
Aw, you guys are the greatest friends
a giant doofus could have.

57
00:05:28,564 --> 00:05:31,032
Good Lord!
Brought down by one beer?

58
00:05:31,134 --> 00:05:33,534
And a couple of these babies.

59
00:05:33,636 --> 00:05:37,970
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm off to the barn dance.

60

<i>Watch his head.</i>

61

Where am I?

62
00:05:48,017 --> 00:05:50,485
Oh, they don't want me anymore.

63
00:05:54,891 --> 00:05:58,190
<i># Paul was just as lonely</i>

<i>and he carved himself a pet ##</i>

65
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:04,890
And now-

66
00:06:05,001 --> 00:06:08,562
Oh, boy.
I wish you were real.

67
00:06:08,671 --> 00:06:12,107
Mmm.

68
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,450
Hey, what the-

69
00:06:22,518 --> 00:06:24,486
Oh, it's a miracle!

70
00:06:24,587 --> 00:06:27,556
I'll call you Babe.
You'll be my best friend.

71
00:06:33,996 --> 00:06:35,964
<i>So Paul and his blue ox Babe...</i>

72

<i>traveled all across this great land,</i>
<i>leavin'their mark.</i>

73

<i>Excuse me. Paul Bunyan</i>
<i>never fought Rodan.</i>

74
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,957
And his size seems to be
really inconsistent.

75
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,358
I mean, one minute,
he's 10 feet tall.

76
00:07:06,462 --> 00:07:08,760
The next,
his feet are as big as a lake.

77
00:07:08,865 --> 00:07:12,266
- Hey, hey, hey! Who's the hobo here?
- I'm just sayin'.

78
00:07:15,471 --> 00:07:18,929
<i># Now Paul and Babe</i>
<i>were a mighty fine match #

- Huh?

80
00:07:24,046 --> 00:07:28,107
<i>She's pretty.</i>

81
00:07:28,217 --> 00:07:31,448
Oh. What a handsome man.

82

Got ya!

83
00:07:48,237 --> 00:07:51,798
Don't worry.
I won't smush you.

84
00:07:51,908 --> 00:07:55,674
- You're cute.
- Oh. Thank you.

85
00:07:55,778 --> 00:07:58,804
Hey, what are you doing?

86
00:07:58,915 --> 00:08:02,578
- I just wanna spruce up for our date.
- Oh.

87
00:08:02,685 --> 00:08:05,586
Whoo-hoo!

88
00:08:15,031 --> 00:08:16,931
Mmm!

89
00:08:24,941 --> 00:08:27,808
Oh!

90
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:33,815
We've been together a long time now.

91
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:37,682
- When are we gonna, you know-
- Soon.

92
00:08:37,787 --> 00:08:41,382
I just need a few more yoga classes.
Oh, look!

93
00:08:41,491 --> 00:08:43,516
A shooting star.

94
00:08:43,626 --> 00:08:47,289
<i>Hey, that meteor's</i>
<i>headed straight for us...</i>

95
00:08:47,396 --> 00:08:50,763
with the fire and the impact
and the 100% chance of pain!

96
00:08:50,867 --> 00:08:52,767
Pain in the glayvin!

97
00:08:52,869 --> 00:08:57,169
God has sent this fiery kill rock
to show us his love.

98
00:08:57,273 --> 00:09:00,504
No! We're gonna die!

99
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:03,204
There's only one man
who can save us.

100
00:09:03,312 --> 00:09:05,212
Oh, I get it.

101
00:09:05,314 --> 00:09:07,544
When I'm crushing and killing you,
you don't like me.

102
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:11,211
But when I can save your life,
suddenly I'm Mr. Popular.

103
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,844
Yeah. That's pretty much it.

104
00:09:12,955 --> 00:09:14,855
Whoo-hoo!
I'm Mr. Popular!

105
00:09:23,132 --> 00:09:25,157
Come on.
Right across the plate.

106
00:09:25,268 --> 00:09:27,168
Let's see what you got, huh?

107
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:30,831
This one's for the little crippled boy...
that I crippled.

108
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,840
You can do it, Paul!

109
00:09:32,942 --> 00:09:35,604
Gimme a kiss for luck.

110
00:09:35,711 --> 00:09:37,440
Ow! Hot!

111
00:09:37,547 --> 00:09:39,947

Oh, come on!
Ow!

113
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:55,720
<i>And that's how Paul Bunyan</i>

114
00:09:55,831 --> 00:09:57,958

115
00:09:58,067 --> 00:10:01,298
- A giant, house crushing, a meteor-

116

Got any more tall tales?

117
00:10:03,406 --> 00:10:06,341
Well, I suppose I could
spin ya a few more yarns.

118
00:10:06,442 --> 00:10:10,742
But first, who wants to give
me a sponge bath? I'm filthy.

119
00:10:12,915 --> 00:10:14,815
All right.
But your next story...

120
00:10:14,917 --> 00:10:16,885
better be worth it.

121
00:10:19,322 --> 00:10:21,222
Get in there good.

122
00:10:21,324 --> 00:10:23,690
Yeah, that's it.
Don't be shy.

123

"I am so tired of you saying
that I put beans in your bindle!

129

130
00:10:46,716 --> 00:10:48,707
"Do you ever shut up?"

131
00:10:48,818 --> 00:10:51,480

Uh, could we hear another tall tale?

133
00:10:58,527 --> 00:11:01,257
In a sec.

134

<i>All righty.</i>

135
00:11:04,433 --> 00:11:07,129
Here's a story just for you, little girl.

136
00:11:07,236 --> 00:11:11,229
It's the tale ofJohnny-
No. Connie Appleseed.

137
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,331
Oh.

138
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:16,710
<i>Back around 1840...</i>

Whoopsie.

145
00:11:33,696 --> 00:11:36,665
Dad, you just killed
a poor defenseless buffalo.

146
00:11:36,766 --> 00:11:38,893
A poor, delicious buffalo.

147
00:11:39,001 --> 00:11:43,199
He'll be dinner for the whole wagon train.

148
00:11:43,305 --> 00:11:45,671
- Why'd you kill another one?
- Dessert.

149
00:11:52,448 --> 00:11:53,881
Ow!

150
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,917
Hey, I found a bullet.

151
00:11:58,688 --> 00:12:01,350
- Man, buffalo are easy to kill.
- <i>People...</i>

152
00:12:01,457 --> 00:12:04,654
if you don't stop this slaughter,
you'll wipe out the buffalo.

153
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,355
Wipe out an entire species?
Why, that's impossible.

154
00:12:19,275 --> 00:12:23,177
Why is it we have ladders
that can put a man on the roof...

155
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,077
but we can't find a
renewable source of food?

156
00:12:26,182 --> 00:12:28,548
Think, Connie. Think.

157
00:12:28,651 --> 00:12:30,983
- <i>Connie.</i>
- Wha-

158
00:12:31,087 --> 00:12:33,681
Connie.

159
00:12:33,789 --> 00:12:37,885
That tree! It seems to be calling to me.

160
00:12:41,797 --> 00:12:45,460
Of course! Apples!

161
00:12:45,568 --> 00:12:47,559
<i>No, Connie, over here!</i>

162
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:50,230
Help me!

163
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:53,137
Mom, Dad, look what I found!

164
00:12:53,242 --> 00:12:56,439
Oh, boy!
Buffalo testicles!

165
00:12:56,545 --> 00:13:00,606
- Mmm!
- No, Dad, they're apples.

166
00:13:00,716 --> 00:13:03,412
Yuck!

167
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,888
Well, that's it. I don't want anything
to do with this wagon train of death.

168
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:11,050
Either switch to apples,
or go on without me.

169
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,287
Hmm!

170
00:13:15,364 --> 00:13:19,130
You'll be sorry!

171
00:13:21,237 --> 00:13:23,205
Oh!

172
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,165
<i>So Connie roamed the prairie alone...</i>

173
00:13:27,276 --> 00:13:29,801
<i>planting apples seeds</i>
<i>all along the way.</i>

174
00:13:29,912 --> 00:13:33,575
<i>She even changed</i>
<i>her last name to Appleseed.</i>

175
00:13:33,682 --> 00:13:37,277
<i>And her family</i>
<i>changed theirs to Bufflekill.</i>

176
00:13:50,766 --> 00:13:53,826
I haven't had buffalo in six hours.
Marge...

177
00:13:53,936 --> 00:13:56,234
how about whipping up
some buffalo sausage...

178
00:13:56,338 --> 00:13:59,705
huevos buffaleros,
and some fresh-squeezed buffal-O. J?

179
00:13:59,809 --> 00:14:03,609
The buffalo are gone.
I think you shot them all.

180
00:14:05,681 --> 00:14:08,548
Oh! Connie was right!

181
00:14:08,651 --> 00:14:11,484
We wiped out the entire species!

182
00:14:11,587 --> 00:14:15,387
What have I done?
What have I done?

183
00:14:15,491 --> 00:14:19,291
Calm down, Pa.
There's two left.

184
00:14:22,398 --> 00:14:26,926
What have I done?
What have I done?

185
00:14:27,036 --> 00:14:30,904
<i>With the buffalo gone, the starving</i>
<i>settlers were driven to cannibalism.</i>

186
00:14:32,508 --> 00:14:34,976
You're the fattest, Bufflekill.

187
00:14:35,077 --> 00:14:37,170
Okay, everybody, dig in!

188
00:14:40,149 --> 00:14:42,049
<i>Stop! I've got apples!</i>

189
00:14:42,151 --> 00:14:44,176
Delicious, nutritious apples.

190
00:14:44,286 --> 00:14:46,481
And there's enough for everyone.

191
00:14:51,126 --> 00:14:53,060
Sweet!

192
00:14:53,162 --> 00:14:55,392
It's like a hootenanny in my mouth!

193
00:14:55,497 --> 00:14:57,556
- We're saved!
- It's a miracle!

194
00:14:57,666 --> 00:15:00,635
- Hooray for Connie Bufflekill!
- What?

195
00:15:00,736 --> 00:15:03,261
So now we're not eating Homer?

196
00:15:04,773 --> 00:15:06,934
And thanks to that little girl...

197
00:15:07,042 --> 00:15:10,170
today you can find apples
in everything that's good.

198
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:12,474
Apple wine, apple whiskey...

199
00:15:12,581 --> 00:15:15,243
apple schnapps, apple martinis...

200
00:15:15,351 --> 00:15:17,717
uh, Snapple with vodka in it...

201
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,811
apple nail polish remover-

202
00:15:19,922 --> 00:15:21,787
Don't forget applesauce.

203
00:15:21,891 --> 00:15:26,260
Yeah. I suppose you could
grind some pills into it.

204
00:15:26,362 --> 00:15:28,227
Aw.

205
00:15:32,568 --> 00:15:36,937
- Look out there, folks. That's the mighty Mississip.
- Big deal.

206
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:40,440
Reminds me of a tall tale
about two scalawags...

207
00:15:40,542 --> 00:15:43,136
rafting down the Big Muddy-

208
00:15:43,245 --> 00:15:45,679
Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn.

209
00:15:45,781 --> 00:15:48,978
That's not a tall tale.
It's a book by Mark Twain.

210
00:15:49,084 --> 00:15:51,917
Look, let's just do this thing.

211
00:15:55,524 --> 00:15:58,618
Whitewashing sucks, Tom.
It powerful sucks.

212
00:15:58,727 --> 00:16:00,627
Morning, friend.

213
00:16:00,729 --> 00:16:03,698
Want your turn at whitewashin'?
It's powerful fun.

214
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:06,927
Why, you ain't fooling me again,
Tom Sawyer.

215
00:16:07,036 --> 00:16:09,163
If I may.

216
00:16:09,271 --> 00:16:11,171
Now get to work!

217
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:16,503
I still got it.

218
00:16:18,614 --> 00:16:21,777
Now, Huckleberry Finn,
you get down from there.

219
00:16:21,884 --> 00:16:24,079
A body could break his neck.

220
00:16:24,186 --> 00:16:26,086
I ain't afeard of that.

221
00:16:26,188 --> 00:16:28,952
I'd just get a new neck off n a cat.

222
00:16:29,058 --> 00:16:31,356
Huck!

223
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:35,021
Oh, Huck, you gave your bones
an awful rattling.

224
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:39,863
Yeah. But I'm feeling
better right now.

225
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:43,295
- <i>Aha!</i>
- Papa!

226
00:16:43,405 --> 00:16:45,566
Hold my daughter's hand, will ya?

227
00:16:45,674 --> 00:16:48,871
I was gonna let go by-and-by.

228
00:16:48,978 --> 00:16:53,210
Well, I guess there's no harm done
as long as it was gonna be by-and-by.

229
00:16:53,315 --> 00:16:55,215
But just to play it safe-

230
00:16:55,317 --> 00:16:58,582
We're gathered here today to force this man...

231
00:16:58,687 --> 00:17:02,350
Huckleberry Finn,
into holy matrimony.

232
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:05,086
How romantic.

233
00:17:05,194 --> 00:17:08,061
This reminds me
of our shotgun wedding.

234
00:17:08,163 --> 00:17:10,097
Grandpa, we've been
married for years.

235
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:12,099
When are you gonna
put down that gun?

236
00:17:12,201 --> 00:17:15,932
Well, I reckon you're right.
Hang it all!

237
00:17:16,038 --> 00:17:19,838
Do you, Huck,
take Becky as your wife?

238
00:17:19,942 --> 00:17:22,308
Whoa!

239
00:17:22,411 --> 00:17:26,279
Hey, they done switched
the groom with a pig!

240
00:17:26,382 --> 00:17:29,510
- No wonder he was pooping so much.
- <i>Ha-ha!</i>

241
00:17:32,087 --> 00:17:34,647
Come on!
Let's get those polecats!

242
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:44,094
Oh! Now we'll never catch 'em!

243
00:17:46,502 --> 00:17:50,097
I reckon we're safe now.
There's the state line.

244
00:17:55,377 --> 00:17:57,538
Uh-oh!
Rapids!

245
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,810
<i>Please do not exit the raft...</i>

246
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,821
<i>until it has come</i>
<i>to a complete stop.</i>

247
00:18:07,923 --> 00:18:10,585
Mr. Silas, this young lady's
flashing her privates.

248
00:18:10,692 --> 00:18:14,560
<i>Oh! Well, I'll dispose of this!</i>

249
00:18:14,663 --> 00:18:17,530
All for Silas. All for Silas.

250
00:18:23,772 --> 00:18:26,366
I'm considerable hungry.
We got any food left?

251
00:18:26,475 --> 00:18:28,409
Hmm. Looks like
we're out of corn pone...

252
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:31,343
fatback, hardtack,
fat pone, "corntack."

253
00:18:31,447 --> 00:18:33,108
- Any "tackback"?
- "Tackback"?

254
00:18:33,215 --> 00:18:34,944
- I mean "backtack."
- Plumb out.

255
00:18:38,554 --> 00:18:41,523
One jug of whiskey,
three plugs of"tobacky"...

256
00:18:41,623 --> 00:18:43,750
and some extra-strength opium.

257
00:18:43,859 --> 00:18:46,953
- That will be two cents, boys.
- Two cents?

258
00:18:47,062 --> 00:18:50,725
Hey, if you think my prices are high,
go across the street.

259
00:18:52,935 --> 00:18:54,800
<i>Thank you. Come again.</i>

260
00:18:54,903 --> 00:18:58,600
- He put the lard pone on top of the egg pone.
- Dang!

261
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,577
Double dang!

262
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,378
Aw, donkey butter!

263
00:19:13,322 --> 00:19:16,553
Oh, it's no use.

264
00:19:16,658 --> 00:19:19,252
I got an idea.

265
00:19:20,829 --> 00:19:23,024
Uh- Hmm.

266
00:19:23,132 --> 00:19:26,465
Well, dog my cats.
They's dis-apporated.

267
00:19:28,537 --> 00:19:33,031
Keep quiet, Huck. They won't look up here
if nothing draws their attention.

268
00:19:33,142 --> 00:19:35,770
# Old man river #

269
00:19:35,878 --> 00:19:40,076
<i># That old man river#</i>

270
00:19:40,182 --> 00:19:44,983
# He just keeps rolling #

271
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:52,251
Well, I see President Fillmore
is in the news again.

272
00:19:52,361 --> 00:19:54,852
Glug, glug, glug.

273
00:19:55,764 --> 00:19:58,460
What'll it be, boys?

274
00:19:58,567 --> 00:20:00,865
- Just three X's for me.
- Give me five.

275
00:20:07,476 --> 00:20:10,502
This ain't no five-X whiskey.
I can still see.

276
00:20:10,612 --> 00:20:12,512
That barkeep's a no-good cheat!

277
00:20:12,614 --> 00:20:15,014
Cheat?

278
00:20:18,887 --> 00:20:23,017
<i>Eh-All right.</i>
<i>We've all got derringers.</i>

279
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:26,424
Now let's just put 'em away.
Nobody here is a cheat.

280
00:20:26,528 --> 00:20:29,361
- Cheat?
- Aw, geez.

281
00:20:32,935 --> 00:20:36,530
Man, those derringer bullets
are weak.

282
00:20:36,638 --> 00:20:38,663
Powerful weak.

283
00:20:38,774 --> 00:20:40,867
Light out, and stay lit out!

284
00:20:46,081 --> 00:20:47,981
Aw, catfish.

285
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:52,577
<i>Let us pray for the souls of these</i>
<i>dearly departed young men...</i>

286
00:20:52,688 --> 00:20:57,387
Huckleberry Finn and Thomas Sawyer.

287
00:21:00,095 --> 00:21:04,122
Now for the traditional lowering
of the bodies into the coffins.

288
00:21:10,639 --> 00:21:13,403
And that was Tom and Huck's
last adventure.

289
00:21:13,508 --> 00:21:16,534
I liked that story,
'cause I was a judge.

290
00:21:16,645 --> 00:21:18,203
Delaware!

291
00:21:18,313 --> 00:21:22,773
Well, this is our stop. Would you
like to come sightseeing with us?

292
00:21:22,884 --> 00:21:26,786
We're gonna visit the place where
JCPenney sends their damaged merchandise.

293
00:21:26,888 --> 00:21:30,483
No, thanks.
I'm gonna keep on ridin' the rails...

294
00:21:30,592 --> 00:21:32,423
swappin' stories for sponge baths.

295
00:21:36,498 --> 00:21:39,592
I believe I told <i>three</i> stories.

296
00:21:40,902 --> 00:21:44,030
Oh!
I'll meet you in Wilmington.

297
00:21:46,508 --> 00:21:48,635
Close the door.

298
00:21:50,579 --> 00:21:54,310
<i>Raise your arm. Okay, the other one.</i>

299
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:57,510
<i>You know, I do, uh, 400 sit-ups a day.</i>

300
00:21:57,619 --> 00:21:59,519
<i>Oh, it shows.</i>
<i>I was gonna say something...</i>

301
00:21:59,621 --> 00:22:02,784
- <i>but I thought it might sound, you know, weird.</i>
- <i>Oh, not at all.</i>

302
00:22:02,891 --> 00:22:05,724
<i>I like when people</i>
<i>say nice things about my body.</i>

303
00:22:05,827 --> 00:22:08,091
<i>And it's important</i>
<i>to feel good about yourself.</i>

304
00:22:08,196 --> 00:22:09,264
<i>Okay, spread your toes.</i>
<i>Oh!</i>

305
00:22:09,264 --> 00:22:11,494
<i>Okay, spread your toes.</i>
<i>Oh!</i>

306
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,501
<i>You know how much glass is in here?</i>

307
00:22:54,676 --> 00:22:56,234
Shh!

308
00:22:56,345 --> 00:22:59,508
<i>Oh, boy! Buffalo testicles!</i>

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
