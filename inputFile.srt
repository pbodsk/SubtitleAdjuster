D'oh!

3
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,789
I can't believe it!
We won another contest.

4
00:01:33,893 --> 00:01:38,262
- The Simpsons are going to Delaware!
- I wanna see Wilmington!

5
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:41,094
- I wanna visit a screen door factory.
- Yep.

6
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:43,863
Delaware's got it all.

7
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,870
<i>You're next, Mr. Simpson.</i>

8
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:49,430
- Hey, wait a minute. Airport tax: Five dollars?
- Sir, it's a standard fee.

9
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:51,942
Well, we are not boarding that plane
unless you waive that tax.

10
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:54,013
Waive it!

11
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:03,821
Stupid anti-fist-shaking laws!

12
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,821
The Simpsons are riding the rails!

13
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:11,123
Cool. A dead hobo.

14
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:15,663
Mornin', folks.

15
00:02:15,768 --> 00:02:18,532
- What are you gonna do to us?
- Now, don't worry.

16
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:21,004
I'm not a stabbin' hobo.
I'm a singin' hobo.

17
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:25,134
# Nothin' beats the hobo life #

18

- Excuse me, Hobo.

20
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:35,046
Can you play something
a little less unnerving?

21
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,316
Sure.

22
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:40,119
I was just having a little fun
with you "nobos."

23
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:43,662
Uh, here's a ballad that'll
set fire to your trash can.

It's a boy!

28
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:03,442
Jeezum crow!

29
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,849
- How was it, honey?
- Whiskey, please.

30
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:09,478
Me "hungee."

<i>Time to make Paul's breakfast.</i>

39
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,748
Hey, Paul, flapjacks!

40
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,493
Flapjacks!

41
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:57,301
Out of the frying pan!

42
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:02,266
Yuck! All right, uh,
let's get started on lunch.

43
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:06,243
- And-Wait. Where's Lenny?
- <i>Hello?</i>

Can anybody hear me?

45
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:11,249
I think I found a way out.

46
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:13,945
It's not pretty, but it'll do.

47
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:19,454
<i>All right, look, we gotta</i>
<i>do something about Bunyan.</i>

48
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:21,754
We're going bankrupt
just feedin' and clothin' the guy...

49
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:23,761
not to mention the crushings.

50
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:28,664
Hey, I say we get him drunk
and drag him out of town.

51
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:31,328
Same way we got rid of
Laura Ingalls Wilder.

52
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,564
Yeah, that's a great idea!

53
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:37,040
Hmm.

54
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:39,543
Uh, hey, Paulie?

55
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:42,410
What say we buy you a beer?

56
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:50,853
Aw, you guys are the greatest friends
a giant doofus could have.

57
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:01,032
Good Lord!
Brought down by one beer?

58
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,534
And a couple of these babies.

59
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:07,970
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm off to the barn dance.

60
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:12,177
<i>Watch his head.</i>

61
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:17,906
Where am I?

62
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:20,485
Oh, they don't want me anymore.

63
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:28,190
<i># Paul was just as lonely</i>
<i>as a man could get #

<i># So he took out his ax</i>
<i>and he carved himself a pet ##</i>

65
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,890
And now-

66
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:38,562
Oh, boy.
I wish you were real.

67
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:42,107
Mmm.

68
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,450
Hey, what the-

69
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,486
Oh, it's a miracle!

70
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:57,556
I'll call you Babe.
You'll be my best friend.

71
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:05,964
<i>So Paul and his blue ox Babe...</i>

72
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:10,001
<i>traveled all across this great land,</i>
<i>leavin'their mark.</i>

73
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,981
<i>Excuse me. Paul Bunyan</i>
<i>never fought Rodan.</i>

74
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,957
And his size seems to be
really inconsistent.

75
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,358
I mean, one minute,
he's 10 feet tall.

76
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:38,760
The next,
his feet are as big as a lake.

77
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:42,266
- Hey, hey, hey! Who's the hobo here?
- I'm just sayin'.

78
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:48,929
<i># Now Paul and Babe</i>
<i>were a mighty fine match #

79
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:53,944
- <i># But the man had an itch</i>
<i>that an ox couldn't scratch ##</i>
- Huh?

80
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:58,107
<i>She's pretty.</i>

81
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:01,448
Oh. What a handsome man.

82
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:18,126
Got ya!

83
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:21,798
Don't worry.
I won't smush you.

84
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:25,674
- You're cute.
- Oh. Thank you.

85
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,804
Hey, what are you doing?

86
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:32,578
- I just wanna spruce up for our date.
- Oh.

87
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:35,586
Whoo-hoo!

88
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:46,931
Mmm!

89
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:57,808
Oh!

90
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:03,815
We've been together a long time now.

91
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:07,682
- When are we gonna, you know-
- Soon.

92
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:11,382
I just need a few more yoga classes.
Oh, look!

93
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,516
A shooting star.

94
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:17,289
<i>Hey, that meteor's</i>
<i>headed straight for us...</i>

95
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:20,763
with the fire and the impact
and the 100% chance of pain!

96
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:22,767
Pain in the glayvin!

97
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:27,169
God has sent this fiery kill rock
to show us his love.

98
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:30,504
No! We're gonna die!

99
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,204
There's only one man
who can save us.

100
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:35,212
Oh, I get it.

101
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:37,544
When I'm crushing and killing you,
you don't like me.

102
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:41,211
But when I can save your life,
suddenly I'm Mr. Popular.

103
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,844
Yeah. That's pretty much it.

104
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:44,855
Whoo-hoo!
I'm Mr. Popular!

105
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:55,157
Come on.
Right across the plate.

106
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,168
Let's see what you got, huh?

107
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:00,831
This one's for the little crippled boy...
that I crippled.

108
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,840
You can do it, Paul!

109
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:05,604
Gimme a kiss for luck.

110
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,440
Ow! Hot!

111
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,947
Oh, boy, that's-

112
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,483
Oh, come on!
Ow!

113
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:25,720
<i>And that's how Paul Bunyan</i>
<i>started the great Chicago fire.</i>

114
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:27,958
Boy, that story had everything.

115
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:31,298
- A giant, house crushing, a meteor-
- Townspeople.

116
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,304
Got any more tall tales?

117
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,341
Well, I suppose I could
spin ya a few more yarns.

118
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:40,742
But first, who wants to give
me a sponge bath? I'm filthy.

119
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,815
All right.
But your next story...

120
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,885
better be worth it.

121
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:51,222
Get in there good.

122
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:53,690
Yeah, that's it.
Don't be shy.

123
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,818
There you go.

124
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:01,659

"Who put the beans in my bindle?"

128
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:14,612
"I am so tired of you saying
that I put beans in your bindle!

129
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:16,614

130
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:18,707
"Do you ever shut up?"

131
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:21,480
"Kiss me, you fool!"

132
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:28,424
Uh, could we hear another tall tale?

133
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:31,257
In a sec.

134
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:34,331
<i>All righty.</i>

135
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:37,129
Here's a story just for you, little girl.

136
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:41,229
It's the tale ofJohnny-
No. Connie Appleseed.

137
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,331
Oh.

138
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,710
<i>Back around 1840...</i>

139

<i>the great pie known as America...</i>

140

Whoopsie.

145
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:06,665
Dad, you just killed
a poor defenseless buffalo.

146
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:08,893
A poor, delicious buffalo.

147
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:13,199
He'll be dinner for the whole wagon train.

148
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:15,671
- Why'd you kill another one?
- Dessert.

149
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:23,881
Ow!

150
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:25,917
Hey, I found a bullet.

151
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,350
- Man, buffalo are easy to kill.
- <i>People...</i>

152
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:34,654
if you don't stop this slaughter,
you'll wipe out the buffalo.

153
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,355
Wipe out an entire species?
Why, that's impossible.

154
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:53,177
Why is it we have ladders
that can put a man on the roof...

155
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,077
but we can't find a
renewable source of food?

156
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:58,548
Think, Connie. Think.

157
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:00,983
- <i>Connie.</i>
- Wha-

158
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:03,681
Connie.

159
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:07,885
That tree! It seems to be calling to me.

160
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:15,460
Of course! Apples!

161
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,559
<i>No, Connie, over here!</i>

162
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,230
Help me!

163
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:23,137
Mom, Dad, look what I found!

164
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:26,439
Oh, boy!
Buffalo testicles!

165
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:30,606
- Mmm!
- No, Dad, they're apples.

166
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:33,412
Yuck!

167
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,888
Well, that's it. I don't want anything
to do with this wagon train of death.

168
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:41,050
Either switch to apples,
or go on without me.

169
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,287
Hmm!

170
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:49,130
You'll be sorry!

171
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:53,205
Oh!

172
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,165
<i>So Connie roamed the prairie alone...</i>

173
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,801
<i>planting apples seeds</i>
<i>all along the way.</i>

174
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:03,575
<i>She even changed</i>
<i>her last name to Appleseed.</i>

175
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:07,277
<i>And her family</i>
<i>changed theirs to Bufflekill.</i>

176
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:23,826
I haven't had buffalo in six hours.
Marge...

177
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:26,234
how about whipping up
some buffalo sausage...

178
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:29,705
huevos buffaleros,
and some fresh-squeezed buffal-O. J?

179
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:33,609
The buffalo are gone.
I think you shot them all.

180
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:38,548
Oh! Connie was right!

181
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,484
We wiped out the entire species!

182
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:45,387
What have I done?
What have I done?

183
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:49,291
Calm down, Pa.
There's two left.

184
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:56,926
What have I done?
What have I done?

185
00:13:57,036 --> 00:14:00,904
<i>With the buffalo gone, the starving</i>
<i>settlers were driven to cannibalism.</i>

186
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,976
You're the fattest, Bufflekill.

187
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:07,170
Okay, everybody, dig in!

188
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:12,049
<i>Stop! I've got apples!</i>

189
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:14,176
Delicious, nutritious apples.

190
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:16,481
And there's enough for everyone.

191
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:23,060
Sweet!

192
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:25,392
It's like a hootenanny in my mouth!

193
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:27,556
- We're saved!
- It's a miracle!

194
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,635
- Hooray for Connie Bufflekill!
- What?

195
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:33,261
So now we're not eating Homer?

196
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:36,934
And thanks to that little girl...

197
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:40,170
today you can find apples
in everything that's good.

198
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,474
Apple wine, apple whiskey...

199
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:45,243
apple schnapps, apple martinis...

200
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:47,717
uh, Snapple with vodka in it...

201
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,811
apple nail polish remover-

202
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:51,787
Don't forget applesauce.

203
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:56,260
Yeah. I suppose you could
grind some pills into it.

204
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:58,227
Aw.

205
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:06,937
- Look out there, folks. That's the mighty Mississip.
- Big deal.

206
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:10,440
Reminds me of a tall tale
about two scalawags...

207
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:13,136
rafting down the Big Muddy-

208
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,679
Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn.

209
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:18,978
That's not a tall tale.
It's a book by Mark Twain.

210
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,917
Look, let's just do this thing.

211
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:28,618
Whitewashing sucks, Tom.
It powerful sucks.

212
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:30,627
Morning, friend.

213
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:33,698
Want your turn at whitewashin'?
It's powerful fun.

214
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:36,927
Why, you ain't fooling me again,
Tom Sawyer.

215
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:39,163
If I may.

216
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,171
Now get to work!

217
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,503
I still got it.

218
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:51,777
Now, Huckleberry Finn,
you get down from there.

219
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:54,079
A body could break his neck.

220
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:56,086
I ain't afeard of that.

221
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:58,952
I'd just get a new neck off n a cat.

222
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:01,356
Huck!

223
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:05,021
Oh, Huck, you gave your bones
an awful rattling.

224
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:09,863
Yeah. But I'm feeling
better right now.

225
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,295
- <i>Aha!</i>
- Papa!

226
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:15,566
Hold my daughter's hand, will ya?

227
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:18,871
I was gonna let go by-and-by.

228
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:23,210
Well, I guess there's no harm done
as long as it was gonna be by-and-by.

229
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,215
But just to play it safe-

230
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:28,582
We're gathered here today to force this man...

231
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:32,350
Huckleberry Finn,
into holy matrimony.

232
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,086
How romantic.

233
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:38,061
This reminds me
of our shotgun wedding.

234
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,097
Grandpa, we've been
married for years.

235
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:42,099
When are you gonna
put down that gun?

236
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:45,932
Well, I reckon you're right.
Hang it all!

237
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:49,838
Do you, Huck,
take Becky as your wife?

238
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:52,308
Whoa!

239
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:56,279
Hey, they done switched
the groom with a pig!

240
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:59,510
- No wonder he was pooping so much.
- <i>Ha-ha!</i>

241
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:04,647
Come on!
Let's get those polecats!

242
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:14,094
Oh! Now we'll never catch 'em!

243
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:20,097
I reckon we're safe now.
There's the state line.

244
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,538
Uh-oh!
Rapids!

245
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,810
<i>Please do not exit the raft...</i>

246
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,821
<i>until it has come</i>
<i>to a complete stop.</i>

247
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:40,585
Mr. Silas, this young lady's
flashing her privates.

248
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:44,560
<i>Oh! Well, I'll dispose of this!</i>

249
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:47,530
All for Silas. All for Silas.

250
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:56,366
I'm considerable hungry.
We got any food left?

251
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:58,409
Hmm. Looks like
we're out of corn pone...

252
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:01,343
fatback, hardtack,
fat pone, "corntack."

253
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:03,108
- Any "tackback"?
- "Tackback"?

254
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:04,944
- I mean "backtack."
- Plumb out.

255
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:11,523
One jug of whiskey,
three plugs of"tobacky"...

256
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:13,750
and some extra-strength opium.

257
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:16,953
- That will be two cents, boys.
- Two cents?

258
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:20,725
Hey, if you think my prices are high,
go across the street.

259
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,800
<i>Thank you. Come again.</i>

260
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:28,600
- He put the lard pone on top of the egg pone.
- Dang!

261
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,577
Double dang!

262
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,378
Aw, donkey butter!

263
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:46,553
Oh, it's no use.

264
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:49,252
I got an idea.

265
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:53,024
Uh- Hmm.

266
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:56,465
Well, dog my cats.
They's dis-apporated.

267
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:03,031
Keep quiet, Huck. They won't look up here
if nothing draws their attention.

268
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,770
# Old man river #

269
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:10,076
<i># That old man river#</i>

270
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:14,983
# He just keeps rolling #

271
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:22,251
Well, I see President Fillmore
is in the news again.

272
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:24,852
Glug, glug, glug.

273
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:28,460
What'll it be, boys?

274
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:30,865
- Just three X's for me.
- Give me five.

275
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:40,502
This ain't no five-X whiskey.
I can still see.

276
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:42,512
That barkeep's a no-good cheat!

277
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:45,014
Cheat?

278
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:53,017
<i>Eh-All right.</i>
<i>We've all got derringers.</i>

279
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:56,424
Now let's just put 'em away.
Nobody here is a cheat.

280
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:59,361
- Cheat?
- Aw, geez.

281
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:06,530
Man, those derringer bullets
are weak.

282
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:08,663
Powerful weak.

283
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:10,867
Light out, and stay lit out!

284
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:17,981
Aw, catfish.

285
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:22,577
<i>Let us pray for the souls of these</i>
<i>dearly departed young men...</i>

286
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:27,387
Huckleberry Finn and Thomas Sawyer.

287
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:34,122
Now for the traditional lowering
of the bodies into the coffins.

288
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:43,403
And that was Tom and Huck's
last adventure.

289
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:46,534
I liked that story,
'cause I was a judge.

290
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:48,203
Delaware!

291
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:52,773
Well, this is our stop. Would you
like to come sightseeing with us?

292
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:56,786
We're gonna visit the place where
JCPenney sends their damaged merchandise.

293
00:20:56,888 --> 00:21:00,483
No, thanks.
I'm gonna keep on ridin' the rails...

294
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,423
swappin' stories for sponge baths.

295
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:09,592
I believe I told <i>three</i> stories.

296
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:14,030
Oh!
I'll meet you in Wilmington.

297
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:18,635
Close the door.

298
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:24,310
<i>Raise your arm. Okay, the other one.</i>

299
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,510
<i>You know, I do, uh, 400 sit-ups a day.</i>

300
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,519
<i>Oh, it shows.</i>
<i>I was gonna say something...</i>

301
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:32,784
- <i>but I thought it might sound, you know, weird.</i>
- <i>Oh, not at all.</i>

302
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:35,724
<i>I like when people</i>
<i>say nice things about my body.</i>

303
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:38,091
<i>And it's important</i>
<i>to feel good about yourself.</i>

304
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:39,264
<i>Okay, spread your toes.</i>
<i>Oh!</i>

305
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:41,494
<i>Okay, spread your toes.</i>
<i>Oh!</i>

306
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,501
<i>You know how much glass is in here?</i>

307
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,234
Shh!

308
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:29,508
<i>Oh, boy! Buffalo testicles!</i>

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
